# Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival
A website to promote Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival

<b>Around the task:</b>

I needed to create a website for the client Jennifer Viala. Jennifer Viala is the founder of Brooklyn Vibes Events Co. and is also the organizer of this year’s Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival. She hopes to select and show films from August 5th to 8th at Brooklyn Bridge Park, a major entertainment venue in New York that can hold up to 5,000 people. She wants to create an event that shows that films can appeal to audiences of all ages, and she wants her advertisements and publications to reflect that same idea! Jennifer has a budget of $3,500 to get the event website up and running. The budget is divided between buying the domain and the hosting online and the work for the design, programming and promoting the website. She needs to communicate online about her festival in order to announce the upcoming showings and take reservations! She needs to publicize the festival, and to do this, she needs a website. On this site, I need to display information about the festival, the films they are showing, and regularly published news or announcements about the festival. There should also be links to the city of Brooklyn’s news website, the Brooklyn Bridge Park’s website, and Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts somewhere on the page (navigation bar, footer links, etc). Before releasing online the website, we need to create the social media profiles and update them with content (photo, video, links) referring to the website newly created. 
Shows will be free and open to everyone, but she wants people to be able to pre-register so that she's able to estimate how many people might come and so that we can close registration if it reaches the venue’s capacity of 5,000 people. The website will be done a month before the film festival: in july the website will be ready for users to sign up. The website includes an info section where all the informations about the event are included. The website includes trailers for all the movies which will be shown in the event. The website includes a map where the place the event will occur is shown. The website includes a section where all the contacts are shown.
The website includes a section in the footer with links for the Brooklyn Bridge Park and Brooklyn Reader.

<b>Style choices:</b>

I choosed a blue background with lines for the website because it expresses trust in our services and it fits well with the text colors in the website. 
Also i choosed orchid and royalblue colors for texts in the website because they express trust, energy and youthfulness for this young, beautiful and joyful event. 
The design is stylish, prestigious, simple, modern and elegant. 

The tecnologies i have used for creating the website are HTML5, CSS3, jQuery and Bootstrap. The website is easy to use and to update, SEO friendly, has a newsletter subscription, mobile ready, has foto and media galleries, has a contact form.
